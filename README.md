## Social Fitness
Social Fitness is a community-driven web application designed to motivate users through social interaction and workout tracking. The platform allows users to create an account, share workout posts with images, specify workout type and intensity, and engage with other users through likes and comments.

The application focuses on simplicity, accessibility, and accountability, providing a space where users can document their fitness journey, interact with a supportive community, and manage their own content through personalised profiles.
